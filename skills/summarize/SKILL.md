# Summarize Skill

Use this skill to turn raw notes or documents into concise, faithful summaries.

## Workflow

1) Identify the audience and desired length (bullets vs. paragraph).
2) Read the source carefully; capture key claims, data, and caveats.
3) Group related points; remove redundancy.
4) Draft a neutral summary that preserves intent and facts.
5) Add citations or line references when available.
6) Provide a short list of actionable next steps if relevant.

## Tips

- Avoid adding new claims; keep hedging language when unsure.
- Prefer bullets for quick scan; keep each bullet to one idea.
- Call out missing data or ambiguities explicitly.
